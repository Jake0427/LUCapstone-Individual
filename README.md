  - If you do not have SQL server Managment Studio Installed, follow this guide: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15.
  - Place the database backup file (ending with ".bak" into your system's SQL database backup folder (EX: C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL14.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Backup).
  - Once SSMS 18 has been installed on your machine connect to (either locally or to a server).
  - Once connected, open the navigation until you see "Databases". Right-Click on Databases, and select "Restore Database".
  - In the restore menu, select the Device Button, then click the "..." symbol on the right side of the screen.
  - Click the "Add" Button on the right side of the screen.
  - Select the "LUCapstone-Individual.bak" File and click "OK" at the bottom of the window.
  - Click "OK" at the bottom of the window once more.
  - Finally, click "OK" at the bottom of the final window.
  - Once the database has been restored, you are ready for the next steps and the application should be able to run and connect without issue.

  - Once that's done Open the CapstoneAPI2.sln file in Visual Studio 2019.
  - Navigate to the "appsettings.json" file
  - Where it says Data Source=".;" change the "." to the connection you used to connect to the database in SSMS.
  - Save the project.
  - open command line and navigate to the project folder (EX: cd C:\Users\\{Username}\Documents\GitHub\LUCapstone-Individual\CapstoneIndividualAPI\CapstoneIndividualAPI).
  - next in command prompt/terminal type "dotnet run" to start the API.
  - Alternatively, click the run button inside Visual Studio 2019 to run the project.
  - A new tab will appear in your default browser, but this can be ignored.

  - Once installed, navigate to the project folder in a command prompt (EX: cd C:\Users\\{Username}\Documents\GitHub\LUCapstone-Individual\LUCapstoneIndividualAngular).
  - type "code ." in the command prompt and it will launch visual studio code.

  - Download the recommended version.
  - Double click the installer and follow the instructions.
  - Open a command line and navigate to the project folder (EX: cd C:\Users\\{Username}\Documents\GitHub\LUCapstone-Individual\LUCapstoneIndividualAngular).
  - in the command prompt type "npm update" to update the packages necessary.
  - to run the project in your browser, in that same command prompt type "ng s --o" (or ng serve --open).
